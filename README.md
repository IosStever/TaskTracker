# TaskTracker

This is the 2nd app I made that saw extensive use and testing.  Key features:

- Data persistence with CoreData
- User can either pull in a list of tasks used before, edit the current list or create a new one
- Tracks time spent between tasks
- Creates a summary report and easy way to send results in an email
